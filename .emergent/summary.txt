<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive, bilingual (German and Ukrainian) frontend for the GENVEX Team delivery service website. The work primarily revolved around iterative content refinement and UI enhancements based on direct user feedback. Key activities included extensive updates to job details, daily schedules, contact information, and company values across all pages. The engineer also ensured consistent branding, implemented a language switcher, and fixed various display and styling issues, notably refining the dark/light theme switcher implementation (and subsequently removing it based on user request). The application currently relies on static mock data, with the contact form lacking backend functionality. The immediate next step involves integrating a Telegram Bot for contact form notifications, as per the user's latest request. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in UI component usage, dynamic content updates, and responsive design, adapting continuously to user feedback.

The user's primary objective was to establish a modern, professional, and bilingual (German/Ukrainian) website for GENVEX Team, an Amazon DSP in Hamburg, Germany, aimed at recruiting delivery drivers. The site needed to clearly convey job specifics, company values, and an easy application process.

Core requirements included:
- **Homepage**: Welcome message, company description, key values (Reliability, Teamwork, Always Connected, Support), and an Apply Now CTA.
- **Open Positions**: Detailed job requirements (Class B license, provided smartphone/clothes, specific parcel weights: 90% up to 2kg, rarely 23kg, no drug test/clean driving history), competitive salary (€15.50 brutto/hour + €10 netto daily for food), benefits (paid training, health insurance, bonus system), and an Submit Application CTA.
- **Life at GENVEX**: Depiction of a typical driver's day (updated schedule: 10:40 AM arrival, 10:50 AM loading, 11:10 AM departure, 7:10 PM return), team imagery (delivery fleet, loading station, clickable Google Maps link for loading station), removal of Recognition and Community sections.
- **FAQ**: Common questions on pay, working hours (Mon-Sat 8:00 - 18:00), uniform, training, and physical requirements. The application/hiring process FAQ was later removed.
- **Contact**: Company address (Peutestrasse 32, 20539 Hamburg), email, phone (+49 176 400 99823), and a contact form with a promise of quick response, including details about paid training. The Prefer to call? section was removed.

Design emphasized a friendly, trustworthy appearance, blue/white color scheme, and conversion optimization. Bilingual support was a key iterative addition.

<current_work>
The GENVEX Team website is currently a fully developed and functional bilingual (German and Ukrainian) frontend application. All content has been meticulously updated and refined based on extensive user feedback throughout the development trajectory.

**Key features and current state:**
*   **Content Accuracy**: All pages (Homepage, Open Positions, Life at GENVEX, FAQ, Contact) now display the latest and most accurate information, including revised salaries (€15.50 brutto/hour), updated daily schedules, correct contact details (Peutestrasse 32, 20539 Hamburg), and refined company branding (GENVEX Team, no DSP).
*   **Bilingual Support**: The language switcher (now using SVG flags) functions correctly, providing seamless navigation between German and Ukrainian content.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements**:
    *   The Loading Station card in Life at GENVEX is clickable and links directly to Google Maps.
    *   The recruitment status badge in Open Positions now shows a clear ❌ Team is complete message.
    *   The website defaulted to a clean light theme after the theme switcher was removed per user request.
*   **Data Source**: The application continues to rely entirely on static mock data ( and ) for all displayed content.
*   **Contact Form Status**: The contact form is present on the frontend and shows a success message upon submission, but this data is **not yet being transmitted or stored anywhere**.

**Nuances & Immediate Focus:**
The previous engineer was in the process of implementing **Telegram Bot integration** to handle contact form submissions. The user provided the Telegram Bot Token and two Chat IDs, and the engineer had just acknowledged receiving the  file for configuration, indicating the backend setup for this integration is the current task at hand. This is the first step towards making the contact form fully functional beyond mock data.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to configure the backend  to integrate with the Telegram Bot API using the provided token and chat IDs for contact form notifications.
